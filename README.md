# Faisal Weekly Blog

## Description

Faisal Weekly Blog is a personal blog site that I worked on for almost 1 full month. This site is a regeneration of the previous version, namely Faisal Daily Blog. By default, the design template used is different from the previous version, where on the Faisal Daily Blog, the appearance is made in dark colors. However, in the current version, I made the appearance with bright colors. The main reason why I changed the color appearance and design template was to differentiate it from the previous version, and to give a unique impression to this site.

The content discussed on this site includes three things, namely, my personal life, my thoughts and opinions about things in the world (including events that may be happening right now), and then my personal hobbies. The categorization of articles on this site is more or less the same as the previous version, but I did not create separate pages for these categories. I combine articles and categories on one page, and that's great convenience and flexibility for readers.

I also combined the feedback form with about me content on the same page, so users don't have to bother looking for the feedback form on this site.

I have updated everything that was in the previous version to make it as easy as possible for users or readers. I also consider access speed on this site, where I reduce the data load in the database by deleting several useless tables and selecting relationships between tables that are really needed. As well as, eliminating the circulation of trash fields which could possibly cause this site to be slow in performance.

Finally, I also selected many packages that were not useful for this site, so that the performance speed of this site would be better.
